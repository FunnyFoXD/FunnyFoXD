# 👋 Hello, my name is Daniil!

I am a novice Go developer(for now... I hope...^_^)

## 🔨 Example of my projects

- [Yandex Practicum project. Scheduler Web Server](https://github.com/FunnyFoXD/go_final_project) — In this project, I used the tools from the Yandex Practicum course in practice. This is a simple web that allows you to add, edit, transfer, and delete everyday tasks. The project implements authorization via JWT-token, and the project can also be run in a Docker container.

## 🌱 I continue to study
- Advanced development on Go (Performance improvement and patterns).
- Developing efficient and secure APIs.
- Reading books about clean code and common mistakes in Go
